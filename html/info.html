            The <b>Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 </b> - also known as the <b>ADA</b> - is a civil rights law <br>
            that was created with the purpose of prohibiting discrimination based on disability. Over the <br>
            years this act has also extended to creating guidelines that help promote accessibility for disabled<br>
            peoples in todayâ€™s society. A more recent development from the ADA are their guidelines on Web <br>
            Accessibility, and as most industries continue to embrace technology, it is important to ensure <br>
            that these new technologies are also made with accessibility in mind. <br><br>

            For our project we have decided to focus our attention on inaccessible <br>
            websites on the Internet for disabled people with visual and/or visual-related disabilities. These <br>
            disabilities can range from low vision to color blindness, as well as dyslexia and certain chronic <br>
            conditions, or others. Some people may be unable to read text that is in a specific font style, size, <br>
            or color. For others that may use screen readers, the user of certain fonts may be unreadable for them. <br>
            And those with eye sensitivities may have trouble reading from web pages with bright colors. Due to these <br>
            challenges, many disabled people can be left unable to access critical web content in an easy and quick manner. <br><br>
        </div>
        <div style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 2em; text-indent: 3%;">
            We would like for our ADA Web Toolbox project to help disabled (and abled) people to make changes to the <br>
            web page they are viewing and promote a more accessible viewing experience. We also hope that this tool <br>
            will help make progress toward the goal of universal web accessibility across the board. <br><br><br>

            Meet the development team - Julia, Haneen, and Karl. They are senior students <br>
            at the University of Michigan-Flint who were united by their shared passion to <br>
            advancing accessibility solutions. They have come together for their senior <br>
            capstone class to develop a Google extension geared towards enhancing and spreading <br>
            awareness about web accessibility. <br><br>
