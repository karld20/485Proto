        The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 - also known as the <b>ADA</b> - is a civil rights law <br>
        that was created with the purpose of prohibiting discrimination based on disability. Over the <br>
        years this act has also extended to creating guidelines that help promote accessibility for disabled<br>
        peoples in todayâ€™s society. A more recent development from the ADA are their guidelines on Web <br>
        Accessibility, and as most industries continue to embrace technology, it is important to ensure <br>
        that these new technologies are also made with accessibility in mind. <br><br>

        For our Capstone project this Fall 2023 semester we have decided to focus our attention on inaccessible <br>
        websites on the Internet for disabled people with visual and/or visual-related disabilities. These <br>
        disabilities can range from low vision to color blindness, as well as dyslexia and certain chronic <br>
        conditions, or others. Some people may be unable to read text that is in a specific font style, size, <br>
        or color. For others that may use screen readers, the user of certain fonts may be unreadable for them. <br>
        And those with eye sensitivities may have trouble reading from web pages with bright colors. Due to these <br>
        challenges, many disabled people can be left unable to access critical web content in an easy and quick manner. <br><br>

    <div style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 2em; text-indent: 3%;">
        We would like for our ADA Web Toolbox project to help disabled (and abled) people to make changes to the <br>
        web page they are viewing and promote a more accessible viewing experience. We also hope that this tool <br>
        will help make progress toward the goal of universal web accessibility across the board. <br><br><br>

        In order to complete this project within the time frame of a single
        semester we will not be creating a fork of a web browser, nor will
        we be able to alter significant usability issues. However, if we find
        that we have completed the requirements for the tool and have time left
        over to devote to other functions, we hope to be able to include the
        ability to generate alt text for images and also generate captions, both
        using AI.
